# Data-Analysis-Project

Welcome,
This is my project as a Data Analyst. 

<h2>
  About the Dataset
</h2>
<br> For the sake of practicing, I download a dataset on Kaggle and build my own Business Context based on this data set and then solve the problem.<br><br>
The dataset belongs to an online retail (ecommerce) company seeks to identify which customers are likely to churn. It consists of customer information such as demographic, historical activities on company's platform,... and the target value 'Churn' which indicates whether a customer has churned or not.
This dataset can be found on Kaggle via this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitverma2010/ecommerce-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction<br><br>

<h2>
Business Context
<h2>
Company X, an e-commerce company, is engaged in a fierce battle with its competitors as a significant number of its customers are switching to rival companies. This shift is affecting Company X's customer retention rates negatively. In response, the company's top-level management has instructed the data team to conduct an analysis of the factors influencing customer retention. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can be seamlessly integrated into Company X's information system, with the aim of enhancing customer satisfaction and securing victory in this competitive battle.<br>

<h2>
Problem definition
<h2>
The problem is finding what factor is mainly causing the increase in number of customer churn, then develop classification machine learning models to predict which customer would churn and it's probabilities (Logistics Regression Model). <br><br>


Let's go! Please see my analysis in Analysis-Notebook.ipynb, this file contains my work in finding insights and develop models in predicting customer churn
