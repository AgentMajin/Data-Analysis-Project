# Data-Analysis-Project

Welcome,
This is my project in analyzing customer behaviour from an Ecommerce dataset. 
I hope that this project may help me in ultilizing skills in Python programming, statistics and extracting valueable insights from a dataset.

<h2>
  About the Dataset
</h2>
This dataset can be found on Kaggle via this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shriyashjagtap/e-commerce-customer-for-behavior-analysis
I also upload a copy version for backup.
The "E-commerce Customer Behavior and Purchase Dataset" is a synthetic dataset generated using the Faker Python library. It simulates a comprehensive e-commerce environment, capturing various aspects of customer behavior and purchase history within a digital marketplace. This dataset has been designed for data analysis and predictive modeling in the field of e-commerce. It is suitable for tasks such as customer churn prediction, market basket analysis, recommendation systems, and trend analysis.

<h3>
  What's the plan
</h3>
So what's I'm gonna do with this dataset?
Well, at this very first step, I just came up with a plan like this:
  - Get general informations about this dataset: name of columns, dtypes of columns, value counting, handling missing values, drop useless columns,...
  - Formulate hypotheses, predictions regarding relationships between features and target, as well as potential trends and insights within the dataset.
  - Check hypothesis, predictions via visualizing and dig into features to find out valueable informations.
  - Make conclusion about insights found with strong evidence taken from dataset.
  - Build a simple dashboard using plotly.
  - Build a simple prediction model to predict customer churn.

That's it, hope that I can achive as much of above as possible. I will update details and result of each step in the below. Let's do it!
